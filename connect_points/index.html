				Motivation
			</h2>
			<p>
				This page was made to aid solving graph connection related problems. Here are some of those problems.
			</p>
			<p>
				Problem 1: Given Hamiltonian cycle whose edges do not self-intersect, find such cycle that maximises d(G).
				<br />
				Problem 2: Given Hamiltonian cycle whose edges do not self-intersect, find such cycle that minimises c(G).
